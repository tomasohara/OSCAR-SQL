 * \file datafolderdialog.h
 * \brief Dialogs and helpers used when OSCAR needs a data folder.
 *
 * OSCAR needs a data folder at startup (first run, or when the folder it last used has
 * disappeared) and when the user asks for a new database from the File menu. Earlier
 * versions handed the user a single directory picker titled "Choose or create a folder",
 * and many users returned the intended *parent* folder without creating anything inside
 * it, so OSCAR's database landed in their Documents folder. These dialogs separate
 * *creating* a new folder (OSCAR creates it from a name and a location) from *finding*
 * an existing one, and validate the result before it is used.

 * Before creating, the dialog rejects names that are not valid folder names, locations that
 * do not exist, and targets that already hold OSCAR 1.x data, an OSCAR 2 database, or any
 * other files. It warns when the location looks cloud-managed, then creates the folder and
 * confirms it is writable. On acceptance folderPath() returns the created folder.

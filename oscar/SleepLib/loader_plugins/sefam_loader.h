/*! \brief Has this hardware model code been validated well enough not to warn?

    Model codes are hardware family identifiers, not product names: the Rêve Auto
    reports "1279R" and the S.Box AUTO has been seen as both "1200R" and "1263R".

    - 1279R — Rêve Auto, reconciled against a manufacturer report over 31
      sessions: event taxonomy, indices, pressures and settings.
    - 1200R — S.Box AUTO, reconciled against a manufacturer report over 6 days:
      event counts per type, operating time and the full settings history.
    - 1263R — S.Box AUTO. No manufacturer report exists for it, so it rides on
      1200R's validation: same product name, same firmware version and the same
      card layout. Its decoded pressure settings were separately checked against
      the pressure the device actually delivered.

    Anything else still warns, which is the point — the loader accepts any card
    matching the directory pattern, so an unrecognised model code means a device
    nobody has checked. */

        \param valid   Per-sample validity, same length as \a values.
        \param chan    Target OSCAR channel.
        \param gain    Multiplier OSCAR applies to each stored value.
        \param rateMs  Milliseconds per sample.
        \param startMs Session start, milliseconds since epoch.

        Invalid samples are excluded and each contiguous run of valid samples
        becomes its own EventList, because one EventList holds one contiguous
        span. Imported naively the 0xFF sentinel would read as 153 L/min leak or
        25.5 cmH2O and corrupt the session statistics.

        Values are pre-scaled rather than passed as raw bytes with an offset
        because OSCAR applies EventList offsets inconsistently: gLineChart
        renders (raw + offset) * gain, while EventList::data() and
        FlowParser::openFlow() apply gain alone and ignore the offset entirely.
        Baking any offset into the stored value keeps graphs and statistics
        in agreement. */

/*
 * XML recording base class
 *
 * While this can be used on its own via the public constructors, it is
 * typically used as a base class for a subclasses that handle specific
 * events.
 *
 * A single instance of this class can write a linear sequence of events to
 * XML, either to a string (for testing) or to a file (for production use).
 *
 * Sometimes, however, there is need for certain sequences to be treated as
 * separate, either due to multithreading (such recording as multiple
 * simultaneous connections), or in order to treat a certain excerpt (such
 * as data download that we might wish to archive) separately.
 *
 * These sequences are handled as "substreams" of the parent stream. The
 * parent stream will typically record a substream's open/close or start/
 * stop along with its ID. The substream will be written to a separate XML
 * stream identified by that ID. Substreams are implemented as subclasses of
 * this base class.
 *
 * TODO: At the moment, only file-based substreams are supported. In theory
 * it should be possible to cache string-based substreams and then insert
 * them inline into the parent after the substream-close event is recorded.

/*
 * XML replay base class
 *
 * A single instance of this class caches events from a previously recorded
 * XML stream, either from a string (for testing) or from a file (for
 * production use).
 *
 * Unlike recording, the replay need not be strictly linear. In fact, the
 * implementation is designed to allow for limited reordering during replay,
 * so that minor changes to code should result in sensible replay until a
 * new recording can be made.
 *
 * There are two aspects to this reordering:
 *
 * First, events can be retrieved (and consumed) in any order, being
 * retrieved by type and ID (and then in order within that type and ID).
 *
 * Second, events that are flagged as random-access (see randomAccess below)
 * will cause the above retrieval to subsequently begin searching on or
 * after the random-access event's timestamp (except for other random-access
 * events, which are always searched from the beginning.)
 *
 * This allow non-stateful events to be replayed arbitrarily, and for
 * stateful events (such as commands sent to a device) to be approximated
 * (where subsequent data received matches the command sent).
 *
 * Furthermore, when events are triggered in the same order as they were
 * during recordering, the above reordering will have no effect, and the
 * original ordering will be replayed identically.
 *
 * See XmlRecorder above for a discussion of substreams.

/*
 * XML replay event base class
 *
 * This class is used to represent a replayable event. An event is created
 * when performing any replayable action, and then recorded (via record())
 * when appropriate. During replay, an event is retrieved from the XmlReplay
 * instance and its previously recorded result should be returned instead of
 * performing the original action.
 *
 * Subclasses are created as subclasses of the XmlReplayBase template (see
 * below), which handles their factory method and tag registration.
 *
 * Subclasses that should be retrieved by ID as well as type will need to
 * override id() to return the ID to use for indexing.
 *
 * Subclasses that represent signal events (rather than API calls) will need
 * to set their m_signal string to the name of the signal to be emitted, and
 * additionally override signal() if they need to pass parameters with the
 * signal.
 *
 * Subclasses that represent random-access events (see discussion above)
 * will need to override randomAccess() to return true.
 *
 * Subclasses whose XML contains raw hexadecimal data will need to override
 * usesData() to return true. Subclasses whose XML contains other data
 * (such as complex data types) will instead need to override read() and
 * write().

Creating OSCAR development environment on Windows, compiling, and building installers
=====================================================================================

This document is intended to be a brief description of how to install the necessary components to build OSCAR and create installers for Windows 64-bit using Qt6. This document was written when Qt 6.9.3 was current and may become dated with future releases of Qt. (See BUILD-WIN-515.md for Qt5 and 32-bit Windows.)

There are three sections to this documentation.

1) Required Programs
2) Start Developing using batch files
3) Start Developing using QtCreator

## Required Programs

The following programs and files are required to create Windows installers:
-   Inno Setup 6 (Inno is used to create the Install version of OSCAR.)
-   GIT for windows
-   QT Open Source edition

**Installing Inno Setup 6**

Inno Setup 6.5 is found on <http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php>. Download and install the latest version.

The deployment batch file assumes that Inno Setup is installed into its default location: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Inno Setup 6. If you put it somewhere else, you will have to change the batch file.

Run the installer
- Accept options to install inno script studio *(for possible future use)*.
- Install Inno Setup Preprocessor.
- Encryption support is not needed, so do not select it.

**Installing GIT for Windows**

Go to <https://gitforwindows.org/> and click on the Download button. Run the installer, which presents lots of options:

-   Select whichever editor you desire.
-   Select “Use Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software.”
-   Select “Use the OpenSSL library.”
-   Select “Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings.”
-   Select “Use Windows’ default console window.”
-   Leave other extra options as they default (enable file system caching, enable Git credential manager).
-   From command line, git config --global core.symlinks true
-   Create SSH key and upload to GitLab. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html.

**Installing Gawk (if Git for Windows’ gawk is not used)**

From <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm>, download setup for “Complete package, except sources”. When downloaded, run the setup program. Accept default options and location. The deployment batch file assumes that gawk.exe is in your PATH, so either add c:\\Program Files (x86)\\gnuwin32\\bin to your PATH or copy the executables to some other directory already in your PATH.

**Installing QT**

-    Browse to https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss.
-    Download and run the Windows x64 installer.
-    Logon with your QT account or create an account if needed.
-    Accept "Open Source Obligations".
-    Click Next to download meta information *(this takes a while)*.
-    Set your installation directory to C:\\Qt. If you choose a different directory, you will need to edit the build BAT file(s).
-    In "Components"
     - Select Qt
     - Select 6.9.3 (or 6.10.0)
        - Under Qt 6.9.3 (or 6.10.0) Additional Libraries, check:
          - Qt 5 Compatibility Module
          - Qt Serial Port.
        - For development use, check:
          - Sources
          - QT Debug Information Files
-    Accept the license and complete the installation *(this takes a longer while)*. 

#### Clone Repository
Whether you use batch files or QTCreator, you will need to get a copy of the OSCAR code.
- In a browser, log into your account at gitlab.com.
- Select the Oscar project at https://gitlab.com/CrimsonNape/OSCAR-code.
- Clone a copy of the repository to a location on your computer.

#### Validate the installed software.

-   Verify Qt

        dir C:\Qt
    
    -   You should see a list of files and folders, including "Tools"
- Verify Git 

      git --version

  -   You should see the version number

-   Verify Inno

        "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC"
    
    - You should see a list of command line options

## Developing Oscar using Qt Creator

The advantage of using QT Creator rather than batch files is easier transition to new versions of Qt. QT Creater will adjust automatically to new versions, while batch files may require that you modify the batch files.  As a starter, we have provided a BUILDALL-qt6.BAT file that works with Qt 6.9.3 or 6.10.0.

### Run and configure Qt Creator

There are two QT Oscar project files: OSCAR_QT.pro in the Oscar-code directory, and Oscar.pro in the Oscar-code\\oscar directory. You may use *either* project file. Both will create a running version of Oscar. Building with Oscar.pro in the Oscar-code\\oscar directory may be very slightly faster, but the difference is negligible.

- Start QT Creator.
- "File" > "Open File or Project" > *(select the .pro file)* 

*QT will ask you to select your kits and configure them.*

- Select the Desktop Qt 6.9.3 or 6.10.0 MinGW 64-bit kit.
- Click on Projects in the left panel to show your active project (“oscar”) and **Build & Run** settings.
- Click on the **Build** line
- In the Build settings in the center panel, select “Release” rather than the default “Debug” in the pull-down at the top of the Build Settings.
- By default, “Enable Qt Quick Compiler” is checked. Remove that check – errors result if it is on. QT will ask if you want to recompile everything now. **Don’t**, as there is more to do before compiling. 
- For the make (not qmake) command, add "SHELL=cmd.exe" as a parameter.
- Make this same change for the Debug build for the kit. 
- If you want to use the QT Creator Debug tools, Select the Build Debug pull-down and disable the QT Quick Compiler there as well.
- 'Build' menu > 'Build Project "OSCAR_QT"' menu item.

With these changes, you can build, debug, and run Oscar from QT Creator. However, to run Oscar from a Windows shortcut, not in the QT environment, you must create a deployment directory that contains all files required by Oscar. 

Creating an installer also an additional step. A deploy.bat file performs two functions. It creates a release directory from which OSCAR may be run and an installer. You can include this deployment file in QT Creator in one of two ways.
   - You can include it as part of QT Creator's build process,
   - or you can do this as a separate deployment step.
To include deployment as part of the Release build process, add a custom process step to the configuration.
- Be sure to select “Release” rather than the default “Debug” in the pull-down at the top of the Build Settings.
- Create a custom process step as the final build step.
- Put the fully qualified path for deploy.bat in the command field.
- Don’t touch “working directory.”
- Any string you care to place in the “arguments” field will be appended to the installer executable file name.
- Now you should be able to build the OSCAR project from the QT Build menu.

If you prefer to run deploy.bat as a separate deployment step,
- Select Run under the kit name in the Build & Run section.
- Under Run Settings, select Add Deploy Step.  
- Now create a custom process step just as described earlier.
- Menu item Build/Deploy will now run this deployment script.

## Developing using batch files

-   Requires Qt, Git and Inno setup described in above section.
-   Batch files buildall-qt6.bat and deploy.bat are used.
-   buildall-qt6.bat creates a build folder, compiles and executes deploy.bat
-   Supports 64 bit Windows
-   Supports Qt 6.9.3 or 6.10.x
-   Auto detection for which compiler to use.
-   buildall-qt6.bat has one command Line option: the Qt6 version to use (e.g, "buildall-qt6.bat 6.10.2")
-   deploy.bat creates a release version and an install version.
-   deploy.bat is also used by QtCreator
-   The release folder contains OSCAR.exe and all other files necessary to run OSCAR
-   The install sub-folder contains the installer for OSCAR*.exe
-   Places the release and install versions of OSCAR in the build folder.

#### Examples use the following assumptions

Git, Qt, and OSCAR may be located in different locations, for example:

-   "C:\\Program Files\\Git"
-   "D:\\Qt"
-   "E:\\OSCAR"

The examples below show all three as being installed on C:\, but other drives may be used.

#### Building Commands

-  Build install version for OSCAR 64 bit Windows
    -   C:\\OSCAR\OSCAR-code\\Building\\Windows\buildall-qt6.bat
-  The current folder is not used by the buildall.bat
-  There is a pause when the build completes.
    -  This insure that the user has a chance to read the build results.
-  Allows using windows shortcuts to build OSCAR and see results.

#### Deploy.bat builds a release directory and a Windows installer.

All references in the deploy.bat file are relative, so it should run with Oscar-code installed at any location.

The deploy.bat file is required to build release and install versions of Oscar using QtCreator or with buildall-qt6.bat. The buildall file compiles Oscar, builds Oscar and calls deploy.bat to create release and install versions of Oscar.


#### Windows Shortcuts
-   Windows shortcuts can be used to execute the build commands or run OSCAR.
    See BUILD-WIN.md for examples

**Compiling and building from the command line**

If you prefer to build from the command line and not use QT Creator, a batch script buildall-qt6.bat will build and create installers for 64-bit Windows. This script has some hard-coded paths, so will need to be modified for your system configuration. 

See BUILD-WIN.md for instructions on building a 32-bit version of OSCAR using an older version of Qt -- Qt5.

**The Deploy.BAT file**

The deployment batch file creates two folders inside the shadow build folder:

Release – everything needed to run OSCAR. You can run OSCAR from this directory just by clicking on it.

Installer – contains an installer exe file that will install OSCAR.

# SEFAM Rêve Auto — SD card format analysis

**Status:** format decoded and **validated against the vendor's own analyzer
report** for the same 31 sessions. Container, waveform scalings, event taxonomy
and therapy settings are all confirmed. Remaining gaps are small and listed at
the end.

**Settings decode, as of 2026-08-13.** Four of the five accessory settings the
analyzer prints are decoded: humidifier level (byte 22), theoretical mask leak
(byte 10), and Comfort Control Plus level **and patient circuit** sharing byte 21.
**Only the heated tube is left**, and it is now known to be unrecoverable — it
exists on the S.Box solely in the file the vendor software writes, not in
anything the device records.

Three of those came from cards with a single setting deliberately changed. The
fourth, the circuit, came from driving *Sefam Analyze* against a card with no
device attached; the same exercise fixed the record's field order, which the
Rêve's own data can never settle — see "The settings record is the S.Box's
table".

**Device:** SEFAM Rêve Auto (APAP). `Created By=REVE_AUTO`, model code `1279R`,
firmware `VER :A010500`. SEFAM is a French sleep-medicine manufacturer.

**Branding:** sold in India as the **Sanrai Rêve Auto** (Sanrai Med is a
distributor). This is a **relabel, not a variant**: the underside of the case is
marked "Sefam", and "Sanrai" appears only on an applied sticker. So the hardware
is a SEFAM unit that was stickered at distribution, and there is no reason to
expect a separate Sanrai firmware line — though regional firmware builds on
identical hardware remain possible in principle, and only a second card would
settle that.

Treat SEFAM and Sanrai as one device family, the way `prisma_loader.cpp` covers
both Weinmann and Löwenstein.

Note the card itself carries **no brand string at all**: the only identity on it
is `REVE_AUTO`, the model code `1279R`, and the serial. This was re-checked
across the whole sample collection — no SEFAM-family card, and no byte of either
memory image, contains "Sefam" or "Sanrai". Detection is unaffected (the model
code and `#03/` header are a solid fingerprint), but whatever brand OSCAR
displays is a naming choice rather than something read from the data, and users
will report this machine under either name.

**Decision (2026-08-10): OSCAR shows this device as a "Sanrai Rêve Auto".**
Since the brand cannot be read off the card, `sefamBrandName()` in
`sefam_loader.cpp` decides it per model: `Created By=REVE_AUTO` or model code
`1279R` gives brand `Sanrai`, and every other SEFAM-family device stays `Sefam`
until a card turns up that argues otherwise. The reasoning is that Sanrai is the
only name printed on the unit its owner actually has, so it is the name they
will look for. `resvent_loader.cpp` resolves the same Hoffrichter/Resvent
question the same way, per model.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- A **French-market Rêve, sold under SEFAM's own name, would also display as
  "Sanrai"** — the loader cannot tell them apart. The working hypothesis is that
  this case does not arise, because SEFAM's own equivalent is sold as the
  **Néa**: if `REVE_AUTO` only ever ships relabelled, "Sanrai" is right every
  time. **This is unverified** — no Néa card has ever been seen, and whether the
  Néa even shares this platform is itself unconfirmed (see the settings-menu
  section below, which borrows from a Néa manual on exactly that assumption).
  Waiting on more users; revisit the rule if a SEFAM-branded Rêve turns up.

  Nothing needs changing to be ready for a Néa card: it would carry neither
  `REVE_AUTO` nor `1279R`, so `sefamBrandName()` already returns "Sefam" for it,
  and `sefamModelIsValidated()` already returns false, which raises the
  untested-device warning and prompts the user for a sample.
- `info.series` is **not** a brand field — it keys the device-image lookup in
  `MachineLoader::getPixmap()`. It stayed `"Sefam"` for one day, then became one
  value per device when the device photos were added (2026-08-10); see "Device
  images" below.

The brand is written to the `machines` row when the device record is first
created, and that row is never rewritten afterwards — `Machine::SaveToDatabase()`
refreshes series, model, model number and serial on an existing record but not
brand. A device imported before this change therefore keeps showing "Sefam";
re-importing into a fresh profile is the way to pick up the new name. That was
judged acceptable rather than worth a migration, since the loader has only ever
shipped in the v2.0.2 draft.

### Device images (added 2026-08-10)

**Built and confirmed rendering the same day** — both the Rêve and the S.Box show
their own photo.

Three photos live in `oscar/icons/` and are bound in through `Resources.qrc`:
`sanrai-reve.png`, `sefam-sbox.png`, `sefam-nea.png`. All lower case, matching
the convention of every other icon in that directory — the filenames must match
the `.qrc` entries exactly or the images vanish on case-sensitive filesystems,
which is most of the platforms OSCAR ships to.

`MachineLoader::getPixmap()` keys on `MachineInfo::series`, so each device that
needs its own image needs its own series value. `series` is an internal key —
nothing in the UI displays it, and its only other reader is a ResMed-specific
S9 check in `welcome.cpp` — so `sefam_loader.cpp` now assigns one per device
(`kSeriesReve`, `kSeriesSBox`, `kSeriesNea`). Both the registration and the
assignment read the same constants, which is deliberate: the AirSense 11 icon
was once invisible because `PeekInfo()` produced `"AirSense11"` while the icon
hash was keyed `"AirSense 11"` (`BUG_FIXES.md`, 3-part ResMed icon entry).

Unlike brand, **series does propagate to an existing `machines` row** —
`Machine::SaveToDatabase()` includes it in the fields it refreshes — so an
already-imported device picks up its image on the next import even though it
keeps its old brand.

**The Néa image is deliberately unreachable.** No Néa card has ever been seen,
so nothing assigns `kSeriesNea`; an unrecognised SEFAM model keeps series
`"Sefam"`, matches no entry, and falls through to the generic CPAP image. Using
the Néa photo as the SEFAM default was considered and rejected — it would put a
photo of an unconfirmed device against whatever turned up. Recognising a Néa is
a one-line addition to `sefamModelOf()` once we know its `Created By` or model
code.

Worth recording: **the Néa and Rêve product photos show the same physical
machine** — same wedge case, same touchscreen layout, same side port, differing
only in the printed logo. That is supporting evidence for the Néa hypothesis
above, though marketing photography is not proof of identical internals.

**Loader:** `sefam_loader.cpp` / `sefamDataParsing.cpp`, added 2026-08-03 from
this analysis. Design: `Notes/loaders/SEFAM_LOADER_DESIGN.md`. **Awaiting testing
by a real user** — everything below was verified against this one card and the
manufacturer's report for it.

Related: `SD_CARD_FINGERPRINTS.md` has an earlier entry for the **SEFAM S.Box
AUTO** (model code `1263R`, firmware `VER :A020400`) — same firmware platform,
different device class. That entry's guess that the obfuscation key is `0x9F` is
**wrong**; see below. Its "~100 byte header" estimate is also wrong (it is 71).

The S.Box is now documented in its own right in
`Notes/loaders/SEFAM_SBOX_CARD_ANALYSIS.md`. It differs from this device more
than the shared platform suggests: no `.LOG` at all, the short 38-byte header
with no UTC epoch, 25 Hz instead of 10 Hz on four channels, and an unencrypted
memory image. **Do not carry a conclusion from one model to the other without
re-testing it.**

One directory per session, numbered sequentially, **not** by date. The sample
holds 31 complete sessions (2026-07-10 → 2026-07-30, 159.0 h) plus a
`DATA_031/` containing only a `.LOG` — the next session's log, opened but with
no recording yet. **A loader must tolerate a partial final directory.**

Sessions are mask-on/mask-off segments, not nights: several nights have a short
1–3 minute session immediately followed by the real 7–8 h one. Merging into
OSCAR days is the loader's job.

The `.ABD/.HRT/.PLS/.POS/.SPO/.STS/.THO` stubs are the polygraph channels the
platform supports but this device does not populate. **File size == header size
means "channel not recorded"** — that is the presence test, since the INI
declares the full schema regardless.

---

## Header obfuscation: XOR 0xBF — header only

The fixed-length text header of every `.LOG` and channel data file is XORed with
the constant `0xBF`. Confirmed by known-plaintext: the header contains the device
serial, which also appears in cleartext in the `.INI`.

```
'0'(0x30)^0xBF = 0x8F     '9'(0x39)^0xBF = 0x86
' '(0x20)^0xBF = 0x9F     'R'(0x52)^0xBF = 0xED
```

This is obfuscation, not encryption — a single constant across the whole card.
The `.INI` is **not** obfuscated (plain text). The `.RAM`/`.BKP` are **not**
XOR-0xBF either (see below).

## File header (after XOR)

Channel files — **71 bytes, fixed**:

```
#03/<serial padded to 20 chars>/<YYMMDDhhmmss>/<32 hex chars>/
 │           20 bytes                12 bytes        32 bytes
 └─ format version
```

> **The leading tag is a format version, not a constant.** The Rêve Auto writes
> `#03/`; the **S.Box AUTO writes `#02/`**. A loader that matches `#03/`
> literally will reject S.Box cards outright. Accept any `#NN/`.
>
> Both observed versions share the same field layout, and header length is
> detected independently of the version, so the number is useful for diagnostics
> but should not gate parsing.

- `<YYMMDDhhmmss>` is **local** time and matches the `.INI` `[Start Record]`
  exactly.
- The 32-hex field is two 8-byte values: the first is the session start as a
  **UTC** Unix epoch, the second is an unidentified signature/checksum.
  In this sample local = UTC+2, consistent throughout.

`.LOG` files — **38 bytes, fixed**: the same string without the 32-hex field.

> **Do not locate the end of the header by scanning for the 4th `/`.** In
> `DATA_017.LOG` a payload byte decodes to `/` and shifts a delimiter-scanning
> parser by two bytes. Use the fixed lengths (71 / 38).

## Record structure — verified on all 31 sessions

After the header, data files are a flat array of fixed records, each holding
**exactly 10 seconds** of samples:

```
[ rate x 10 sample bytes ][ checksum 1 byte ][ sequence 2 bytes, big-endian ]
```

- **checksum** = low 8 bits of the sum of the record's data bytes.
  Verified 3075/3075 records on every channel of the longest session.
- **sequence** = 1-based, strictly incremental.
- Record sizes: 10 Hz → 103 B, 5 Hz → 53 B, 1 Hz → 13 B.
  (`.PLS` is 75 Hz / 16-bit → 1503 B, unexercised in this sample.)

`file_size == header + N * record_size` holds exactly for all 31 sessions ×
6 populated channels — the layout is confirmed, not inferred.

Session duration = `N × 10` seconds. Sample rates come from the `.INI`, so the
reader can be fully data-driven.

## The `.INI` — schema only

Cleartext, parseable with `QSettings::IniFormat`. Contains `[Create Info]`
(firmware, serial, creation date), `[BLE Device]`/`[Oximeter]`/`[PolyLink]`
pairing addresses, `[Start Record]`, and `[Chan0]`–`[Chan11]` giving each
channel's `Name`, `Type`, `Unit`, `Min`, `Max`, `Freq`, `Bit`.

**Every `.INI` on the card is byte-identical apart from the timestamp fields.**
There are **no therapy settings** — no mode, pressure range, ramp, EPR or
humidifier. This is the format's biggest gap for OSCAR (see *Open problems*).

`Y17` is not declared in the `.INI` at all, but is present and populated.

---

## Channel scaling — confirmed

| Channel | Rate | Formula | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FLW` | 10 Hz | `-180 + raw × 460/255` L/min | INI `Min=-180 Max=280`; zero at raw ≈ 99.8 |
| `PRE` | 5 Hz | `raw × 0.1` cmH₂O | see below |
| `LK` | 1 Hz | `raw × 0.6` L/min | INI `Min=0 Max=153` → 153/255 = 0.6 |

`raw == 255` is the **invalid/no-data sentinel** on all three (whole 10-second
records of `0xFF` appear when the blower is off).

**Pressure is ×0.1, not ×0.2.** Across all 31 sessions the true `PRE` range
(excluding the sentinel) is 0–154, i.e. **0.0–15.4 cmH₂O**; ×0.2 would imply
30.8 cmH₂O, which no CPAP delivers. Percentiles: p5 = 4.0, p50 = 5.1,
p90 = 7.5, p99 = 11.8 cmH₂O — a patient sitting near the 4 cmH₂O APAP floor
most of the night.

**`PRE` is a MASK pressure, and the card has no plain therapy pressure.** The
trace carries the breathing ripple — about 1.0 cmH₂O peak to peak, on a setpoint
that walks slowly (4.1 → 9.2 cmH₂O over one session). Nothing else on the card
carries a pressure:

- `PRE` is the only channel declared with `Unit=cmH20`.
- `DET`, `NSD` and `Y17` are bit fields, not analogue signals — see their
  sections below for the value histograms.
- No `.LOG` record reports a pressure. Of the 17 codes present, only 2 and 13
  have non-zero payloads, and both are settings records.
- The manufacturer's own report publishes only an **average** pressure per
  session, and shows `Prescribed pressure` as `-` because the mode is A-PAP.

A therapy-pressure trace must therefore be *derived*. The ripple separates
cleanly: a 10-second moving average cuts it to roughly 0.1 cmH₂O — the channel's
own quantisation step — while shifting the session average by under 0.007 cmH₂O.
See `SEFAM_LOADER_DESIGN.md` §6 for the filter choice and the measurements
behind it.

**Two independent cross-checks confirm the flow and leak scales simultaneously:**

1. At the same instant, the `FLW` baseline and `LK` agree. `FLW` raw ≈ 113 →
   23.8 L/min; `LK` raw ≈ 38 → 22.8 L/min. So `FLW` is **total** flow
   (patient + leak), not patient flow.
2. Binning `LK` by concurrent `PRE` over a whole night gives a clean orifice
   law `LK_raw ≈ k·√P` with k essentially constant:

   | PRE (cmH₂O) | 4.0 | 4.5 | 5.0 | 5.5 | 6.0 | 6.5 | 7.0 | 7.5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | mean LK raw | 38.1 | 41.2 | 45.1 | 46.7 | 47.1 | 49.7 | 57.9 | 57.7 |
   | k = LK/√P | 19.1 | 19.4 | 20.2 | 19.9 | 19.2 | 19.5 | 21.9 | 21.1 |

   Converted, that is ≈23 L/min at 4 cmH₂O rising to ≈37 at 10 — textbook
   vented-mask flow. So `LK` is **total leak including intentional mask vent**,
   which OSCAR must handle the way it does for ResMed/PRS1 total-leak devices.

## `DET` — breath-phase bitfield (10 Hz)

Not a data channel; a per-sample flag byte. Bit occupancy over one night and
mean concurrent flow:

| Bit | Set | Mean flow SET | Mean flow CLEAR | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 35.1 % | **42.6 L/min** | **18.3 L/min** | **inspiration** — confirmed |
| 6 | 12.8 % | 42.9 | 24.4 | sub-phase of inspiration (peak flow) |
| 1 | 89.1 % | 26.5 | 29.0 | likely "valid / patient connected" |
| 0 | 6.3 % | 30.0 | 26.6 | unknown |
| 4 | 0.8 % | 39.4 | 26.7 | unknown |
| 7 | 4.7 % | 32.2 | 26.5 | unknown |
| 2, 3 | <0.3 % | — | — | unknown |

Bit 5's 35 % occupancy is exactly a normal I:E ratio and the flow separation is
unambiguous. This gives a loader free breath-phase segmentation without
detecting it from the flow signal.

## `Y17` — event bitfield (10 Hz), meanings unknown

Undeclared 10 Hz flag byte, 99 % zero. Bits 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 are used. Runs are
mostly 0.7–0.8 s with occasional 10 s ones. Per-hour run rates are stable
across sessions (bit5 ≈ 19–30/h, bit0 ≈ 7–14/h), which is the profile of a
real respiratory-event channel — but **which** events is not established.

**`Y17` runs do not line up with `.LOG` records** (only ~4 % of runs fall within
±3 s of any log entry), so the two are independent views, not duplicates.

> **This is measured correctly but reasoned from too narrowly.** A ±3 s window
> cannot see a constant offset larger than itself, and there is one: widening the
> search to ±60 s puts bit 3 at a sharp −28 s from every snore record (the modal
> offset in 28 of 30 sessions) and bit 0 at the implied start of 88 % of
> flow-limitation records. So `Y17` and the `.LOG` are *not* independent for at
> least two event types. The conclusion that `Y17` cannot supply events still
> holds — it over-counts both by 1.5–2× and tracks apnoeas and hypopnoeas poorly
> — but "does not line up" is the wrong reason. See the `Y17` section of
> `SEFAM_SBOX_CARD_ANALYSIS.md`.

Since the `.LOG` is now confirmed as the scored-event source, `Y17` is *not*
needed for AHI.

### `Y17` does NOT carry event extents — tested and excluded

It was long assumed here that `Y17`'s most likely role was per-sample event
**extent**, which would have supplied the hypopnea durations the log omits.
**That was tested directly and it fails.**

`Y17` is undeclared in the `.INI`, so its geometry was inferred from a channel
that is declared: 103 bytes per 10 s record against `PRE`'s 53, i.e. 100 samples
plus the usual 3-byte trailer — **10 Hz, 8-bit**, identical in every session on
the card. Every apnea and hypopnea in the log was then mapped onto it through
the session's UTC epoch, and the non-zero run containing each event measured:

| | OA | CA | OH | CH |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Events with any `Y17` activity within ±2 s | 15/290 | 22/252 | 4/90 | 16/304 |
| Mean length of the run that is present | 0.77 s | 0.76 s | 0.70 s | 0.76 s |

Two independent reasons this cannot be an event extent:

1. **It is absent for ~93 % of events.** An extent channel would mark all of
   them.
2. **Where present the runs are ~0.75 s, and the same length for all four event
   types.** `Y17` marks brief instants, not spans. Nothing 16 seconds long is
   being recorded there.

Whatever `Y17` is — its per-hour run rates are stable across sessions, which
still looks like a real respiratory signal — it is not the hypopnea duration
source, and a loader can continue to ignore it.

`NSD` is a near-constant bit field. Counted over all 5,724,100 samples on the
card: `0` 99.636 %, `1` 17,610 samples (0.308 %), `4` 120 samples (0.002 %),
`255` sentinel 3,100 (0.054 %) — four distinct values in total. Not literally
empty, but there is nothing to decode from it here.

For comparison, `Y17` takes 11 distinct values card-wide (0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32,
33, 36, 40, 128, 255) and `DET` takes 93, structured as
{low 2 bits} × {`0x00`, `0x10`, `0x20` … `0xF0`} with `0x02` alone accounting
for 55 % of samples. All three are bit fields; none can carry a pressure.

## `.LOG` — 49-byte event records

```
offset 0  : uint32 LE  Unix epoch (UTC)
offset 4  : uint32     always 0   (upper half of a 64-bit time_t)
offset 8  : uint8      event code
offset 9  : uint16 BE  argument
offset 11 : 38 bytes   zero, except codes 2/13 which populate ~bytes 11-25
```

### Event codes — CONFIRMED against the vendor report

The manufacturer's *Sefam Analyze* software was run over this same card,
producing a per-session CSV and a period synthesis. Matching its event counts
against the log census settles the taxonomy:

| Code | OSCAR event | log n | report n | log /h | report /h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | **Obstructive Apnea** | 248 | 242 | 1.56 | 1.5 |
| 4 | **Central Apnea** | 191 | 190 | 1.20 | 1.2 |
| 5 | **Obstructive Hypopnea** | 76 | 75 | 0.47 | 0.5 |
| 6 | **Central Hypopnea** | 233 | 232 | 1.46 | 1.5 |
| 7 | **Snore** | 1408 | 1399 | 8.86 | 8.8 |
| 8 | **Flow limitation** | 961 | — | 6.05 | 6.1 |
| 2 | **Settings change** | 5 | 3 | | |
| 9 | therapy stop (`PRE`≈0, `LK`=255 → blower off) | 42 | | 0.26 | |
| 10 | unidentified | 260 | | 1.64 | |
| 13 | settings/state snapshot | 13 | | | |
| 1, 11, 12, 21, 24, 27, 28 | ≤11 each, administrative | | | | |

Agreement is **per session**, not just in total — on most of the 31 sessions the
four apnea/hypopnea counts match exactly. The residual over-counts (≤6 across
21 days) are the analyzer applying inclusion rules the raw log does not; its own
synthesis header says it filters on ramp and leak state.

Every derived index reconciles arithmetically:

```
AHI (OA,OH,CA)     1.56 + 0.47 + 1.20               = 3.23   report 3.2
AHI (OA,OH,CA,CH)  1.56 + 0.47 + 1.20 + 1.46        = 4.69   report 4.7
AHI obstructive    1.56 + 0.47                      = 2.03   report 2.0
AHI central        1.20 + 1.46                      = 2.66   report 2.7
```

**Apnea duration = argument × 0.1 s.** Decoded mean 16.5 s for code 3 and 12.8 s
for code 4, against a reported average apnoea duration of **17 s (OA) | 13 s
(CA)**. The hard floor at exactly 100 is the ≥10 s scoring rule.

**Hypopnea duration is *not* in the argument, and is not anywhere else on the
card either.** Measured over all 39 sessions of the second card:

| Code | Event | Records | Argument = 0 | Non-zero values |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | OA | 290 | **0** | mean 16.08 s, floor exactly 10.0, max 110.0 |
| 4 | CA | 252 | **0** | mean 12.59 s, floor exactly 10.0, max 49.0 |
| 5 | OH | 90 | **88** | 30.7 and 38.0 s only |
| 6 | CH | 304 | **299** | 24.0 – 30.1 s, five values |

Apneas carry a duration on *every* record. Hypopneas carry zero on 98 %, and the
seven that do not are **longer** than the 16 s / 15 s averages the report prints,
so they cannot be the source of those figures either. The 38-byte payload is all
zeros on every event code — only codes 2 and 13 use it.

So the analyzer computes hypopnea durations rather than reading them. The likely
route is re-scoring `FLW`: it takes counts from the `.LOG` (they match per
session) and apnea durations from the log argument (16.5 / 12.8 decoded against
17 / 13 reported), and hypopnea extent is precisely the quantity the device does
not store but a PC re-reading the waveform recovers easily. That is inference,
not proof, and confirming it would mean replicating their scoring — no payoff
for OSCAR, which renders events itself.

**`Y17` is positively excluded as the source — see its section below.**

### Settings records — codes 2 and 13

Bytes 11–25 are zero on every code **except 2 and 13**, which carry the therapy
settings. Decoded against the report's printed settings (`Mode=A-PAP`,
`Min=4.0`, `Max=20.0`, `Ramp=45 min`, `Ramp pressure=4.0`, `CC+=Level 2`,
`Humidifier=Level 4`, `Heated tube=Present`):

**Code 2** payload `40 45 45 31 200 40 60 60 130 200 121 4 6 3 0`, with the
record's own bytes 9–10 (`80 164`) belonging to it as well — see
"The settings record is the S.Box's table" below for why those two count:

| Byte | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | 80 | unassigned |
| 10 | 164 | **Theoretical mask leak, lpm in bits 0–6** — `0x80 \| 36` — confirmed by a controlled change |
| 11 | 40 | **Ramp start pressure 4.0** (×0.1 cmH₂O) |
| 12 | 45 | ramp duration echo |
| 13 | 45 | **Ramp 45 min** |
| 14 | 31 | flags, includes the ramp mode |
| 15 | 200 | **Max pressure 20.0** (×0.1 cmH₂O) |
| 16 | 40 | **Min pressure 4.0** (×0.1 cmH₂O) |
| 17, 18 | 60, 60 | constant on **both** models — not the mask leak, see below |
| 19 | 130 | **apnoea response pressure 13.0 cmH₂O** (named by the S.Box vendor report) |
| 20 | 200 | unassigned |
| 21 | 121 | **CC+ level in bits 7–6**, level = field + 1 — confirmed by a controlled change |
| 22 | 4 | **Humidifier level** — confirmed by a controlled change, see below |
| 23–25 | 6, 3, 0 | unassigned |

Code 2 occurs 5 times. The report's `setting change` column is non-zero on
exactly the two sessions carrying multiple code-2 records (counts 1 and 2,
matching), and **byte 23 is the only byte that differs** between the pair on the
session reporting two changes — so byte 23 is the field that was edited.

**Byte 23 is therefore ruled out as any of the reported settings.** It changes
6 → 5 → 6 within one session across 60 seconds, while the analyzer reports the
comfort, humidifier and heated-tube settings as *identical on every session*.
Whatever byte 23 holds, the analyzer does not print it.

**Code 13** payload `[0/1] 0 3 40 100 200 0 [5–10] [0/1] 51 55 50 57 55 52`
repeats min (40 → 4.0) and max (200 → 20.0) pressure and adds a mode-like `3`
at byte 13 and a varying 5–10 counter at byte 18. Bytes 20–25 are a constant
six-byte tail.

This **overturns the earlier conclusion that settings were unrecoverable** — they
are in the `.LOG`, not the encrypted `.RAM`. Enough is confirmed for a loader to
report mode, pressure range and ramp; the comfort/humidifier fields are
candidates pending a second card with different settings to vary them against.

### Humidifier level — byte 22, CONFIRMED by a controlled change

A second card was pulled from the same device after the humidifier level was
changed from 4 to 5 and nothing else was touched. This is the controlled
experiment the section below asks for, and it settles byte 22 outright.

The second card is a strict superset of the first: same serial directory, and
of the 468 files the two have in common, **465 are byte-identical**. The three
that differ are the two encrypted state blobs (`.RAM`, `.BKP`, expected) and the
one session directory that was still being written when the first card was
copied. The device accumulates rather than rotating, so the earlier sessions
carry over untouched and act as their own control.

Across every settings record on the second card:

| Record | Date | Byte 22 | Rest of the payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| code 2 | 07-10 | 4 | `40 45 45 31 200 40 60 60 130 200 121 · 6 3 0` |
| code 2 | 07-12 | 4 | identical |
| code 2 | 07-26 (×2) | 4 | identical but for byte 23, already ruled out |
| code 2 | 07-27 | 4 | identical |
| code 2 | 07-31 | 4 | identical but for byte 14, see below |
| code 2 | 08-05 | **5** | **identical** |

**One setting changed by one step; exactly one byte changed, by exactly one
step.** With two points that both map to themselves, any affine reading is
pinned to identity — the byte is the level, unscaled and unbiased. Together with
the vendor manual's documented range of OFF to 10, which fits a raw byte
directly, that is enough to import.

The loader therefore reports it, as a SEFAM-specific `SETTING` channel rather
than through `CPAP_HumidSetting` — that generic id resolves through
`schema::channel["HumidSet"]`, and nothing in OSCAR ever registers a channel of
that name, so it is an empty channel and anything written to it is invisible.

Two limits worth keeping in view:

- **Only code 2 carries it.** A code 13 snapshot has a different payload shape
  and no humidifier field, so a session whose only settings record is a snapshot
  reports no humidifier level rather than an inherited one.
- **The change is bracketed, not timed.** Byte 22 reads 4 on 07-31 and 5 on
  08-05, with no settings record on the four nights between. Those nights
  inherit 4 by carry-forward. Whether code 2 is emitted *at* a change or as
  routine session bookkeeping is still unsettled — the vendor's own
  "setting change" column was non-zero only on sessions carrying *more than one*
  code 2 record, which argues for the routine reading and means the four
  intervening nights may have run at level 5.

**Byte 14 moved too, but on a different night.** It reads 31 (`0x1F`) on every
record except 07-31, where it is 29 (`0x1D`) — bit `0x02` cleared, four nights
before the humidifier record and back to 31 afterwards. It is therefore *not*
the humidifier. It remains the most flags-like byte in the record and is now
also known to be the only other one that ever varies, which makes it the best
candidate for the patient access lock or a tube/circuit state. No vendor report
exists for the second card, so what was different that night is unknown.

### Theoretical mask leak — byte 10, CONFIRMED by a controlled change

A third card was pulled from the same device with the **theoretical mask leak
changed from 36 to 34 lpm** and the Comfort Control Plus level from 2 to 3. It
settles both fields and refutes the previous reading of the mask leak outright.

The field is **byte 10, holding the value in lpm in its low seven bits**:

| | byte 10 | bits 0–6 | analyzer / tester |
|---|---|---|---|
| every record before the change | `0xA4` | 36 | report prints **36 lpm** |
| the record after it | `0x22` | 34 | tester set **34 lpm** |

Two points, exact, on a scale with no fitted constant — and the second was
**pre-registered**. The prediction table written before the card existed listed
"reads 34" as the outcome that would mean the setting is stored in literal lpm.
It does; the table only had the wrong byte. The value fits in seven bits with room
to spare, and 164 is outside any plausible leak, so bit 7 has to be a separate
flag.

> **The real value range is 18–60, not the manual's 20–60.** *Sefam Analyze*
> ships its mask database as `masks.txt` — `maker;type;model;leak`, 89 masks from

**Bytes 17 and 18 are not the mask leak.** They read 60 before and 60 after,
across a change that moved the setting by two steps. The reading that made them
36.0 lpm at the leak channel's own 0.6 lpm per count — 60 × 0.6 — was arithmetic
that happened to land on the printed figure. The S.Box confirms it independently:
its settings table holds the same constant 60, 60 on a different device with a
different mask, where it cannot be that device's mask leak either.

**Do not retry any of these.** All three were live candidates before the third
card and all three are now dead: `round(lpm / 0.6)` and `lpm + 24` and
`2·lpm − 12` all predicted bytes 17/18 would move to 56–58, and neither byte
moved at all.

The vent-curve fit recorded against the second card — binning the 5th-percentile
leak by pressure over 749,448 paired samples, giving leak ≈ 9.94·√P lpm and so
34.4 lpm at the manual's reference 12 cmH₂O against a 36 lpm nameplate — was
sound physics and is left standing, but it tested the mask, not the byte map. It
never had the power to locate a field, and locating the field did not need it.

**Bit 7 of byte 10 is unexplained.** It was set on every record while the leak
read 36 and cleared on the record where it reads 34. See "Two bits cleared
together" below.

### Comfort Control Plus — byte 21 bits 7–6, CONFIRMED by a controlled change

The same card raised CC+ from level 2 to level 3, and byte 21 is the only other
settings byte that moved:

| | byte 21 | bits 7–6 | bits 5–0 | CC+ level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| before | `0x79` | 1 | `0x39` | 2 |
| after | `0xB9` | 2 | `0x39` | 3 |

So **level = field + 1**, pinned by two points exactly as the humidifier byte
was, with room in two bits for levels 1–4 — of which the vendor manual documents
1, 2 and 3.

**Byte 21 turned out to carry a second setting**, found later on the S.Box by
driving *Sefam Analyze* with no device attached (see that note). The full field:

| bits | meaning |
|---|---|
| 7–6 | CC+ level − 1 |
| 5–3 | set when CC+ is enabled; all clear when it is off |
| 0 | patient circuit: set = 15 mm, clear = 22 mm |

`0x79` therefore reads as CC+ level 2 **and 15 mm**, and this card's report prints
exactly that pair. Writes of CC+ off, 1 and 3 produced `0x00`, `0x38` and `0xB8`,
which is where the enable bits and the level field come from; a separate pair of
writes moved bit 0 alone between the two diameters.

Decoded across every settings record on every card held — 478 in total, 467 S.Box
archive blocks and 11 Rêve code 2 records — the level never falls outside the
documented 1–3, and both cards that have a vendor report match it on **both**
settings at once. Circuit Select, the vendor's third diameter choice, cannot be
expressed by a single bit and would read as 22 mm; no card has exercised it. Byte 21 held 121 on all eleven
settings records spanning a month — through three humidifier changes and the two
isolated nights when byte 14 dropped to 29 — and moved once, on the record where
CC+ changed.

**Byte 14 cannot be the level even though it moved at the same moment.** It went
`0x1F` → `0x0F`, clearing bit 4. Read as any field that contains bit 4, the value
*decreases*: bits 3–4 read 3 → 1, bits 4–5 read 1 → 0. The level increased. No
reading of byte 14 rises by one step here, and byte 21's does.

**The change is visible in the pressure trace, which is what makes it more than a
byte correlation.** CC+ is expiratory relief, so raising it must deepen the drop
from inspiratory to expiratory mask pressure. Measured breath by breath — using
`DET` bit 5 for the phase, so the slowly-walking APAP setpoint cannot influence
it — over the 34 full nights on the card:

| | 34 nights before | the night after |
|---|---|---|
| median inspiration → expiration pressure swing | 0.345 – 0.535 cmH₂O | **0.707** |
| median inspiratory flow amplitude | 23.1 – 29.3 L/min | 27.3 |
| median total leak | 22.2 – 27.6 L/min | 22.8 |
| swing ÷ flow amplitude | 1.355 – 1.827 | **2.587** |

The swing lands 32 % above the highest of 34 nights, and 42 % above the highest
ratio, while the flow amplitude and the leak sit mid-range and match the
immediately preceding night almost exactly (27.0 L/min and 22.8 L/min). **So the
circuit did not change and the patient's breathing did not change; only the
pressure the device delivered against that breathing did.** A mask swap — the
obvious confound, given the tester also changed the configured mask leak — would
have moved the vent leak and the flow amplitude together with the swing. It moved
neither. One CC+ level is worth roughly **0.26 cmH₂O** of extra expiratory relief
on this device.

### The settings record is the S.Box's table, one byte per field

The Rêve's code 2 payload and the S.Box's 12-field settings record
(`SEFAM_SBOX_CARD_ANALYSIS.md`) are **the same structure**. The S.Box stores each
field as a uint16 little-endian and the Rêve as a single byte, and the field
order is identical.

The alignment is read against the S.Box's **archive block header**, not its
settings table, because the block header carries the record already rotated —
`[word 10, word 11, word 0 … word 9]` — and that rotation is exactly the Rêve's
byte order. Verified directly on all 467 blocks of one S.Box card:

| position | S.Box block word | Rêve byte | Field | S.Box | Rêve |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 29 | 9 | per-device, unassigned | 50 | 80 |
| 1 | 30 | **10** | **theoretical mask leak, lpm in bits 0–6** | 164 | 164 → 34 |
| 2 | 31 | 11 | ramp start pressure ×10 | 80 | 40 |
| 3 | 32 | 12 | ramp duration echo | 15 | 45 |
| 4 | 33 | 13 | ramp duration, minutes | 15 | 45 |
| 5 | 34 | 14 | ramp mode + flags | 9 | 31 → 15 |
| 6 | 35 | 15 | maximum pressure ×10 | 190 | 200 |
| 7 | 36 | 16 | minimum pressure ×10 | 120 | 40 |
| 8 | 37 | 17 | constant | 60 | 60 |
| 9 | 38 | 18 | constant | 60 | 60 |
| 10 | 39 | 19 | apnoea response pressure ×10 | 130 | 130 |
| 11 | 40 | **21** | **CC+ level and patient circuit, packed** | 184 | 121 → 185 |

Rêve byte 20 has no S.Box counterpart and is unassigned; see the note below.

Twelve consecutive positions line up. Four carry identical values on the two
models — the 60, 60, 130 run and the 164 — and the rest each hold that model's
own correct setting: the Rêve's ramp start 4.0, ramp 45 min, maximum 20.0 and
minimum 4.0 all match its vendor report under this alignment, as the S.Box's
8.0 / 15 min / 19.0 / 12.0 match its own.

**The Rêve's record continues past the twelve and the S.Box's does not.** Bytes
21–25 are Rêve-only, and two of them are known: byte 21 is the CC+ level and
byte 22 the humidifier level, both confirmed by controlled changes. **So the
S.Box's word 10 is not the Rêve's CC+ byte** — the position that lines up with
word 10 is the Rêve's byte 9, which is unassigned on both models. Anyone carrying
the Rêve's `bits 7–6` reading across to that word will be wrong.

The S.Box does have both settings — its vendor report prints `Humidifier Level 2`
and `Comfort Control Plus Level 3` — so they are stored somewhere on that model
too, just not where this record puts them. Word 10 is the surviving candidate
there; see the S.Box note. *(An earlier revision of this section said the S.Box
"appears to have no humidifier". That was a guess from the record's shape and the
report contradicts it.)*

Two things follow that the Rêve's data could never have given on its own:

1. **The field order is settled.** The Rêve has minimum pressure equal to its
   ramp start pressure (both 4.0) and its ramp duration equal to its ramp echo
   (both 45), so its own records cannot separate either pair. The S.Box's do,
   across six vendor-printed snapshots in which minimum, maximum, ramp duration,
   ramp mode and ramp start pressure all vary.
2. **Byte 19 = 130 is a pressure, not a bit-field.** The S.Box vendor report
   names it: apnoea response pressure, 13.0 cmH₂O. The `0x82` bit-field reading —
   `0x80` tube present, `0x02` CC+ level 2 — is dead, and so is the byte 19
   reference-pressure idea already rejected above. It was a plain number all
   along.

> **The obvious alignment is two positions off, and it very nearly stuck.**
> Lining the Rêve's byte 11 up with the S.Box's *table* word 0 also matches the

### Two bits cleared together, and what they might mark

Two single bits moved on the same record as the two settings, and neither is
attributable to one change rather than the other:

- **byte 10 bit 7**, set while the leak read 36, cleared when it read 34
- **byte 14 bit 4**, `0x1F` → `0x0F`

The reading that fits every observation is a **factory-defaults or
not-yet-modified-by-a-clinician marker**:

- Byte 14 is the S.Box's ramp mode word, where the values seen are 8 (T.Ramp),
  12 (I.Ramp) and **28 only in the factory slot** — 28 is 12 with bit 4 set. The
  Rêve read 31 (= 28 plus two low flags) from the first record on the card until
  this change, and 15 (= 12 plus the same two flags) after it.
- It survived everything in the *user* menu. A month of humidifier changes —
  4 → 5 → 4 → 7 — never touched it. The mask leak is a *clinical* menu setting,
  and the first clinical-menu edit ever seen on this device cleared it.

That is a coherent story and it is not a confirmed one. It is also nearly
untestable now: a bit that only ever clears cannot be exercised again on this
device.


### What is left, and why the remaining two are hard

*(Written against the first card, when all five accessory settings were open.
Three of the five have since been pinned by controlled changes — humidifier,
mask leak, CC+ — and the argument below now applies only to the last two.)*

The analyzer's full device-settings panel for the first card reads:

| Setting | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Comfort Control Plus | Level 2 | **byte 21 bits 7–6**, confirmed |
| Theoretical mask leak | 36 lpm | **byte 10 bits 0–6**, confirmed |
| Humidifier | Level 4 | **byte 22**, confirmed |
| Patient Circuit | 15 mm | open — solved on the S.Box, does not transfer here |
| Heated tube | Present | open — exists only in `upload.dat` on the S.Box |

**Both survivors are two-state settings that have never varied**, so there is
still nothing to correlate them against, and both would be a single bit. The
unassigned candidates are bytes 9, 20, 23, 24 and the four low bits of byte 14.

1. **The one discriminating session is unusable.** The analyzer reports
   `Heated tube = Missing` on exactly one session of 31 — and that session's
   `.LOG` contains **no code 2 and no code 13 record at all**. Its whole log is
   codes 28, 9, 10 and 7, every one of them zero-payload, and those codes also
   appear in 8–22 other sessions where the tube reads `Present`. So the single
   place where a setting differs carries no settings record to compare.

2. **`Patient Circuit` and `Theoretical mask leak` do not appear in the
   analyzer's CSV export at all** — only CC+, humidifier and heated tube do.
   That was once read as evidence they are not stored on the card, and the mask
   leak has since been found sitting in byte 10. Absence from the CSV says
   something about the analyzer's export, not about the card, so the same
   inference should not be drawn about the patient circuit either.

**Searching for the printed value turned out to be the right instinct after
all** — but only once the search covered the whole record. The humidifier stores
its level literally in byte 22 and the mask leak stores its lpm literally in
byte 10; what hid the second one for two cards was not a scale, it was reading
bytes 9–10 as a log argument and never looking there. An earlier revision of this
note drew the opposite lesson and told the reader to stop asking "does this byte
equal the printed number". That advice was wrong, and it is what cost the time.

**Nothing should be written into the loader for the last two until a card varies
one of them.** Importing a setting off a lone byte-value match risks showing a
user a setting their device does not have. The method that settled the other
three is unchanged: one night from the *same* device with a **single** setting
changed. It has now worked three times out of three.

> **On changing two settings at once.** The third card changed the mask leak and
> CC+ together, against this note's own advice, and it still resolved — but only
> because both fields moved in ways their own values identified, and it left two
> stray bits that cannot be attributed to either change. That is exactly the cost
> the warning predicted. One setting at a time remains the rule.

### Settings menu structure, from a vendor manual

A user manual for the SEFAM **Nea** documents the full settings menu. Whether
the Nea shares this platform is **not verified**, but its documented ranges are
consistent with everything observed here, so they are recorded as constraints on
the code 2 byte map.

**User menu:** treatment parameters (pressure, usually clinician-locked);
comfort (ramp time, Comfort Control Plus level); humidification, **OFF to 10**.

**Clinical menu:**

| Setting | Documented range |
|---|---|
| Mode | CPAP (fixed) or APAP |
| Min pressure | 4–20 cmH₂O |
| Max pressure | up to 20 cmH₂O (APAP) |
| Fixed pressure level | 4–20 cmH₂O (CPAP) |
| Ramp type | I RAMP, T RAMP or OFF |
| Ramp time | 5–45 min |
| Ramp pressure | start pressure |
| CC+ (Comfort Control Plus) | toggle in the clinical menu, *level* in the user menu — see below |
| IS (Intelligent Start) | toggle |
| Circuit select | 15 mm or 22 mm |
| Mask select theoretical leak | 20–60 lpm **in steps of 2**, being the mask's leak **at 12 cmH₂O** taken from its datasheet |
| Patient access lock | Ramp, CC+, IS |

What this does and does not settle:

1. **It corroborates the confirmed bytes.** Min 4.0 is the bottom of the 4–20
   range, max 20.0 the top, and ramp 45 the top of 5–45. Consistent with this
   card running the same firmware family — supporting evidence, not proof.
2. **Humidification runs 0–10**, so byte 22 = 4 is dimensionally plausible as
   "Level 4". This was later **confirmed** by a controlled 4 → 5 change; the
   documented range is what says a raw byte needs no scaling.
3. **Circuit select is a two-way choice (15 or 22 mm)**, so it can only be an
   enum or a single bit. That explains why no byte holds 15 or 22, and rules out
   any further search for a literal diameter.
4. ~~**Mask leak is configured over 20–60 lpm, and bytes 17 and 18 both hold
   exactly 60**, the top of that range, yet the analyzer prints 36 — unresolved.~~
   ~~**Superseded.** Read in the leak channel's own 0.6 lpm counts, 60 counts
   *is* 36.0 lpm.~~ **Both readings were wrong.** The mask leak is byte 10, in
   plain lpm; bytes 17 and 18 are an unrelated constant that the S.Box holds too.
   The documented 20–60 lpm range in steps of 2 is what byte 10 actually carries.
5. ~~**Byte 21 = 121 → 12.1 cmH₂O** is a candidate for the CPAP Pressure Level.~~
   **Dead.** Byte 21 is the CC+ level in bits 7–6; its low six bits held `0x39`
   across a change of level and are not a pressure. The device has no fixed
   pressure to store in A-PAP anyway, which is why the analyzer prints
   `Prescribed pressure = -`.
6. **Ramp type has three states and mode two**, so both are small enums. Byte 14
   carries the ramp mode — the S.Box uses 8 for T.Ramp and 12 for I.Ramp in the
   same field — so byte 24 = 3 is no longer needed to explain it.
7. **Patient access lock covers three toggles**, so a small bitmask exists
   somewhere. Byte 14's four low bits are the remaining candidate: the byte is
   the ramp mode plus flags, bit 1 drops on two isolated nights, and bit 4 looks
   instead like a factory-defaults marker (see "Two bits cleared together").
8. **Two documented features have never been seen in any card data:** Intelligent
   Start and the patient access lock.
9. **CC+ appears as a toggle in the clinical menu and as a level in the user
   menu**, which reads at first like a contradiction with the analyzer's
   "Level 2". It is not, and the level half is now confirmed in byte 21 bits 7–6.
   The clinician enable, if it is stored separately at all, has not been found —
   ~~the `0x82` byte 19 reading~~ is dead, byte 19 being the apnoea response
   pressure. A clinician enable plus a patient-selectable strength remains the
   right model; only the enable is still missing.

## `.RAM` / `.BKP` — encrypted, not readable **on this model**

The S.Box writes the same two files **unencrypted**, and its therapy settings
turned out to live in them as a 12-slot table of 24-byte records — see
`SEFAM_SBOX_CARD_ANALYSIS.md`. That table is not present in the Rêve's images
(searched for its known minimum/maximum pressure pair in every plausible width
and order), which is consistent with the encryption below rather than with the
structure being absent. Nothing here contradicts what follows; it just means the
files are worth attacking, not ignoring.

Both 1,633,228 bytes. The first 74 bytes are structured cleartext (`4c 00 00 01`,
then a uint32 LE timestamp at offset 4, then a fixed block); everything after is
**8.000 bits/byte entropy in every one of 398 4 KB windows** — no plaintext, and
not XOR-0xBF.

The `.RAM` and `.BKP` in this sample were written ~6 h apart and differ in only
**1,803 of 1.6 M bytes (0.1 %)**, with all other offsets byte-identical. Content
changes therefore stay positionally local, which rules out CBC/CTR with a varying
IV and points to ECB or a fixed keystream. That makes a known-plaintext attack
conceivable *if* a card ever arrives with its device settings independently
known — but nothing is readable today.

## Validation summary

Everything below was checked against *Sefam Analyze* output for the same 31
sessions, not merely inferred from the card:

| Quantity | Result |
|---|---|
| Session→directory mapping | 31/31, `DATA_nnn` ↔ report session `n+1`, timestamps exact |
| Event taxonomy (OA/CA/OH/CH/snore/FL) | confirmed, per session and in total |
| Derived indices (AHI and components) | reconcile arithmetically to ±0.05 |
| Apnea durations | 16.5 / 12.8 s decoded vs 17 / 13 s reported |
| `PRE` × 0.1 cmH₂O | mean pressure matches report on **30 of 31 sessions within ±0.17 cmH₂O**, most within ±0.05 |
| Total recorded time | 159.0 h decoded vs "operating time 159 h 18" reported |
| Therapy settings | min/max pressure, ramp time and ramp pressure all recovered from log code 2 (field *order* within the record was later fixed against the S.Box table) |
| Mask-disconnect seconds | `LK`==255 matches exactly where disconnects are long (412 s session: 412 decoded) |

The one session where mean pressure differs (−1.08 cmH₂O) is the 20-minute
session that was 23 % mask-disconnected — the analyzer excludes disconnected
time from the average, so the disagreement is expected and explains itself.

Three further fields were confirmed by a different method: later cards from the
same device with a known setting changed and no analyzer output to check against,
so the confirmation rests on the controlled change rather than on a printed
report.

| Field | Byte | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Humidifier level | 22 | 4 → 5 | one byte moved, 4 → 5 |
| Theoretical mask leak | 10, bits 0–6 | 36 → 34 lpm | 36 → 34, and bytes 17/18 refuted |
| Comfort Control Plus | 21, bits 7–6 | level 2 → 3 | field 1 → 2, and the pressure trace agrees |

The CC+ result carries an independent physical check that the other two do not:
the measured expiratory pressure relief rose past the range of all 34 preceding
nights while flow amplitude and leak stayed put. See its section.

## Open problems

1. **Hypopnea durations** are not on the card. Codes 5/6 carry a zero argument on
   98 % of records, the payload is zero on every event code, and ~~`Y17`~~ is now
   **positively excluded** (absent for ~93 % of events; runs of ~0.75 s where
   present). The analyzer must compute them, most plausibly by re-scoring `FLW`.
   Not worth chasing further: OSCAR renders events itself, so replicating a
   vendor scoring algorithm buys nothing. What *is* worth remembering is that the
   loader's 16 s / 15 s flag-placement constants came from this one patient's
   report and are not device constants — see "Loader viability".
2. **`Y17` bit meanings** still unknown, and it is now known *not* to be an event
   extent channel (see its section). It is not the apnea source either — the
   `.LOG` is — and its runs do not line up with log records, so it remains an
   independent signal of unknown purpose. Nothing depends on it.
3. **Log code 10** (260 records, 1.64/h) is unidentified and matches no report
   column.
4. **Comfort and accessory setting bytes** in code 2. Byte 23 is ruled out
   entirely. Status of the five:
   - ~~Humidifier level~~ **RESOLVED: byte 22**, confirmed by a controlled
     single-setting change.
   - ~~Theoretical mask leak~~ **RESOLVED: byte 10, bits 0–6, in plain lpm**,
     confirmed by a controlled 36 → 34 change. The bytes 17/18 candidacy is
     **refuted** — neither byte moved.
   - ~~Comfort Control Plus level~~ **RESOLVED: byte 21, bits 7–6**, level =
     field + 1, confirmed by a controlled 2 → 3 change and visible in the
     pressure trace as 0.26 cmH₂O of extra expiratory relief.
   - **Patient circuit and heated tube** remain unassigned. Both are two-state,
     neither has ever varied, and no byte holds 15, 22 or 1.

   A controlled single-setting change settles each of these; see "What is left,
   and why the remaining two are hard".
9. **Two stray bits** — byte 10 bit 7 and byte 14 bit 4 — cleared on the same
   record as the mask-leak and CC+ changes and belong to neither setting's value.
   A factory-defaults marker is the reading that fits; see "Two bits cleared
   together".
5. ~~**Report "Average leaks"**~~ **RESOLVED.** The analyzer reports
   *unintentional* leak in **L/s**: its 0.06 / 0.05 / 0.03 for three sample
   sessions are 3.6 / 3.0 / 1.8 L/min, against OSCAR's derived `CPAP_Leak` of
   2.77 / 3.73 / 1.73 for the same sessions. The card itself gives **total**
   leak, which OSCAR imports as `CPAP_LeakTotal` and converts.
6. The 8-byte header signature is unidentified (not needed to read data).
7. `NSD` is 99.64 % zero in this sample, with only four distinct values;
   purpose unknown.
8. `.RAM`/`.BKP` remain encrypted — but this no longer matters, since the
   settings turned out to be in the `.LOG`.

## What would still help

- **One night with a single setting changed** — still the cheapest and most
  useful next artefact, and it does not need a different device. It has now
  settled three fields out of three attempts. Note that a settings record has to
  actually appear afterwards — four nights on the second card carry none at all —
  so the card should be pulled a night or two after the change, not the same
  morning.
- **Circuit select switched between 15 mm and 22 mm**, and **the heated tube
  disconnected for one night**, are the two probes left. Both are two-state, so
  neither can be found by value matching, and both need a controlled change to
  locate at all. The candidate bits are byte 14's four low bits, and bytes 9, 20,
  23 and 24. Change one, not both.
- **A card in fixed-CPAP mode** — would confirm the mode encoding (only `A-PAP`
  has ever been seen) and show which log codes change.
- A card whose report shows **non-zero "No breath"** events, to identify code 10.

## Loader viability

**Good.** The container was always the easy part; the vendor report has now also
settled the two things that actually blocked a useful loader — the event
taxonomy and the therapy settings. A loader can produce flow, pressure, leak,
breath phase, OA/CA/OH/CH with real durations for apneas, snore, flow
limitation, AHI, and the pressure/ramp settings, with every one of those
validated against the manufacturer's own analysis of the same nights.

Two caveats for implementation. Apnea durations come from the log argument but
**hypopnea durations do not, and cannot be recovered** — they are not on the
card in any form (open problem 1), so they stay zero-duration flags.

> **A live wart, worth knowing about.** Because the hypopnea log timestamp sits
> at the event *end*, the loader shifts those flags back for display by
> `kObstructiveHypopneaPlacementMs` = 16 s and `kCentralHypopneaPlacementMs` =
> 15 s. **Those two numbers are one patient's 21-day averages from one vendor
> report** — not device constants. For any other user they will be wrong by
> however much that person's hypopneas differ, in whichever direction. The
> stored duration stays zero so nothing false appears in a tooltip, but the flag
> position is a guess calibrated on a single dataset. Revisit it the first time
> a second real user's data can be compared.

And the analyzer applies inclusion filtering
(ramp, leak) that the raw log does not, so OSCAR's counts will run a few events
higher across a 3-week period; that is a scoring-policy difference, not a bug,
and it should not be "fixed" by inventing filters to match.

Note the platform is shared with the S.Box AUTO (different model code, different
firmware, 25 Hz flow, and a shorter header in that sample). Header length and
sample rates must be taken from the data and the `.INI`, never hardcoded, if one
loader is to cover both.

# OSCAR Bug Fix Log

Notable bugs found and fixed during development/investigation.

## 2026-03-12 — Statistics page month names not translated in Qt6

**Files:** `oscar/statistics.cpp`

**Symptom:** In Monthly report mode, column headers showing month names (e.g., "January", "February") were always displayed in English regardless of the active language. Worked correctly under Qt5.

**Root cause:** `QDate::toString(format)` behaviour changed between Qt5 and Qt6. In Qt5 it used the application's default locale for month/day names. In Qt6 it always uses the C locale (English). This is a documented Qt6 breaking change.

**Fix:** Changed `s.toString("MMMM<br>yyyy")` to `QLocale().toString(s, "MMMM<br>yyyy")` on line 1460, which explicitly uses the application locale and works correctly in both Qt5 and Qt6.

## 2026-03-12 — QDateEdit ignoreOlderSessionsDate displays incorrectly under translation

**Files:** `oscar/preferencesdialog.ui`, `Translations/Francais.fr.ts`

**Symptom:** The "Do not import sessions older than" date field in Preferences displayed strange/uneditable content when a non-English language (specifically French) was active.

**Root cause:** The `displayFormat` property (`dd MMMM yyyy`) of the `QDateEdit` widget was a plain `<string>` in the `.ui` file, so Qt's `uic` wrapped it in `tr()`. The French translation mapped it to `jj MMMM aaaa` (using French abbreviations jour/an), which are not valid Qt date format codes. Qt treated `jj` and `aaaa` as literal text, causing the widget to display literal "jj" and "aaaa" instead of numeric day and year.

**Fix:** Added `notr="true"` to the `displayFormat` string in `preferencesdialog.ui` so the format is never translated. Qt's `MMMM` token already renders month names in the application locale's language, so no translation of the format string is needed. Also corrected the French translation from `jj MMMM aaaa` to `dd MMMM yyyy`; this entry will become obsolete after the next `lupdate` run.

## 2026-03-12 — Purged data reappears after OSCAR restart

**File:** `oscar/SleepLib/session.cpp`, `Session::Destroy()`

**Symptom:** Purging a day (or all data) via Data → Advanced appeared to work, but after closing and restarting OSCAR the purged sessions were still present.

**Root cause:** `Session::Destroy()` only deleted the legacy `.000` summary and `.001` event files from disk, but never removed the session row from the SQLite database. Since summary file storage was moved to the database (`.000` writes are disabled), nothing was actually deleted — the files didn't exist and the DB rows remained intact. On restart OSCAR loaded sessions from the database, restoring all "purged" data.

**Fix:** Added `SessionRepository::remove(m_sessionrow_id)` call in `Session::Destroy()` before `unlinkSession()`. The DB schema uses `ON DELETE CASCADE` on all child tables (session_channels, session_slices, session_settings, event_lists, respiratory_events, etc.), so a single delete of the sessions row cleans up everything.

## 2026-03-12 — Rebuild-from-backup erases backup directory in BMC loaders

**Files:** `oscar/SleepLib/loader_plugins/bmc_loader.cpp`, `oscar/SleepLib/loader_plugins/bmcg3x_loader.cpp`, `Open()`

**Symptom:** "Rebuild from backup" for BMC and BMC G3x machines silently destroyed the backup data it was trying to import from, leaving the machine with no backup after the rebuild.

**Root cause:** Both `BmcLoader::Open()` and `BmcG3xLoader::Open()` unconditionally erase and recreate `mach->getBackupPath()` then copy `dirpath` into it. When rebuilding from backup, `dirpath` IS the backup directory, so the backup was wiped before any data was read.

**Fix:** Before the erase-and-copy block in both loaders, compare `QDir::cleanPath(dirpath)` to `QDir::cleanPath(backupPath)`. If they are equal, skip the backup creation entirely. `QDir::cleanPath()` normalises trailing slashes so the comparison is reliable.

## 2026-03-12 — gOverviewGraph crash on mouse-over (Overview page)

**File:** `oscar/Graphs/gOverviewGraph.cpp`, `mouseMoveEvent()`

**Symptom:** OSCAR crashes when moving the mouse over the Feelings plot on the Overview page, if Feelings has only been set for one day.

**Root cause:** `d.value()` was called on a `QHash` iterator (`d = m_values.find(hl_day)`) before the guard `d != m_values.end()` was checked. When hovering over any day without a Feelings entry, `d` is the end iterator — dereferencing it is undefined behaviour and crashes.

**Stack trace frame:** `gOverviewGraph::mouseMoveEvent` at line 1079 (original), `QHash::iterator::value()`.

**Fix:** Moved `QMap<short, EventDataType> &valhash = d.value();` to inside the `if ((d != m_values.end()) && (day != nullptr))` block, so it is only evaluated when the iterator is valid. `valhash` is only used within that block, so no other changes were needed.
